## Note
As I already did this projet with Becode/Keller5, I took time to explore things I hadn't understand/had time to explore before :
- understand bundling, transpiling, linting, formatting and package managers with Javascript 
- create a project with Vite, and get used to it utilisation, and working
- understand environnement variables
- try to secure my API key from exposing it on github (WIP)
- clarify relative paths
